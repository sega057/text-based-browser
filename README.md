# Text-Based Browser

## About

This is a simple text-based browser that can display web pages and save them to a local directory. It is a project from [JetBrains Academy](https://hyperskill.org/projects/79) that I completed in Python.

## How to use

The program takes one argument, which is the directory where the pages will be saved. If the directory does not exist, it will be created. The program will then prompt the user for a URL. The user can enter a URL or a command. The commands are:

-   `back` - go back to the previous page
-   `exit` - exit the program
